Improvements with Gen AI

1) Add a CPU difficulty level that you code based on GenAI - different levels for example
1st grader, high schooler, university graduate, PhD graduate (the times would fluctuate)
The GenAI component would come in because you can use prompt engineering "Pretend you are a 1st grader, what do 
you think the reasoning for this would be"

2) Use Gen AI to track your learning metrics and assign you a rank based on how often you play and your scores.
For example when you start let's say you score and average of -5 then it would put you at a first grader level.
Then you can use a Gen AI or ML algorithm to spit out a chart report of your lacking categories and it can prompt 
you with different resources to brush up on general knowledge in these aspects.

3) Use Gen AI to analyse the question pool and assign scores based on what it thinks the difficulty is. Bonues points if
it reduces the scores as you play more often and get smarter.

4) Use Gen AI to generate a color palette or alternative way to play the game for persons who are colorblind or
visually impaired.
